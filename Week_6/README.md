Week 6
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Learnt Redux(an essential package to pair with React) by creating a simple calculator app.

As the application grew bigger, finding ways to access objects became much more complex and challenging. In order to solve this, I learnt "Redux" which can be used to implement reducers to dispatch state/objects throughtout files in the app. Thus, access to state became much more easier.
